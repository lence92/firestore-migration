# Export-Import Script

This project contains a Node.js TypeScript script named `export-import.ts` used for exporting and importing data. It is intended to be executed from the command line using `ts-node`.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v16 or later recommended)
- **TypeScript** and **ts-node** (automatically handled by `npx`)
- **sudo** privileges (required if the script accesses protected resources)

## Run Command

First, install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

To run the script, use the following command:

```bash
sudo npx ts-node export-import.ts
